Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns.
Human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, are the main cause.

SDG 13 focuses on Climate Action to combat climate change and its impacts.

Reducing carbon footprint includes saving electricity, using public transport,
reducing plastic use, and adopting renewable energy.

Climate action is important for sustainable cities as it reduces pollution,
improves public health, and protects future generations.
